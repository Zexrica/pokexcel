# pokexcel

Very hacky code, but it works.  
Put Pokepaste URLs in the text box seperated by spaces and click `download csv`.  
If everything goes right, you should get a csv file with all pokemon in it in the following format:  
`pokemon | item | ability | nature | move1 | move2 | move3 | move4`
  
needed this for some friendly tournaments :3  

## Formatting
Values in CSV will be comma-seperated. This should make it so that values are shown in seperate cells.  
If this is not the case, change your settings by selecting the entire left-most column, going to `Text to Columns` and making sure `Comma` is checked.
