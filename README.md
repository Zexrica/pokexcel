# pokexcel

Very hacky code, but it works
Add pokepast files to the top of Extract.js and load the index.html up
click download csv and, if everything goes right, you should get a csv file with all pokemon in it in the:
pokemon item ability nature move1 move2 move3 move4 format

needed this for some friendly tournaments :3
